Business Ethics and Conduct
The successful business operation and reputation of the Company is built on the principles of fair dealing and
ethical conduct of our Teammates. The continued success of the Company is dependent upon the trust of our
customers, clients and vendors. Teammates have an obligation to the Company and its customers, clients and
vendors to act in a way that will preserve that trust and merit the continued trust and confidence of the public.
In general, good judgment, based on strong legal and ethical principles, will guide you with respect to acceptable
conduct. For specific guidance, all Teammates are expected to review, understand and comply with the Company’s
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Teammates should discuss any situation in which the proper course of action
is unclear with their supervisor/manager, next level of management or Human Resources. Disregarding or failing
to comply with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may lead to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment. Actual or suspected violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
can be made verbally, or in writing, to the highest-ranking on-site supervisor or manager, any member of
management, legal, or internal audit. You may also contact the Company’s Ethics Line at 888-325-7882 or online
