Outside Employment
The Company respects each Teammate’s right to engage in activities outside of employment such as those that
are of a personal or private nature, to the extent that such activities do not create a conflict of interest as described
in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy or adversely affect the Teammate’s ability to perform
their job. Under certain circumstances, however, if a Teammate’s personal conduct adversely affects their
performance on the job or makes it impossible for them to carry out any or all of their job duties while at work,
appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, may be appropriate.
An example of an activity that might adversely affect a Teammate’s ability to perform their job duties is outside
employment. While the Company does not prohibit Teammates from holding other jobs, the following types of
outside employment are generally prohibited (to the extent allowed under applicable law):
• Employment that conflicts with the Teammate's work schedule, duties and responsibilities or creates an
actual conflict of interest;
• Employment that impairs or has a detrimental effect on the Teammate's work performance with the
Company;
• Employment that requires Teammates to conduct work or related activities during working times or use
any of the Company’s tools, materials, or equipment (including Company-provided internet or wireless
services); and
• Employment that directly or indirectly competes with the business or the interests of the Company.
For the purposes of this policy, self-employment or consulting is considered outside employment. The Company
will not assume any responsibility for Teammates outside employment. Specifically, the Company will not provide
workers’ compensation coverage or any other benefit for injuries occurring from, or arising out of, such outside
employment.
