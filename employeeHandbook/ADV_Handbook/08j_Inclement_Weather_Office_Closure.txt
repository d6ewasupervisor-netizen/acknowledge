Inclement Weather / Office Closure
At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures or earthquakes, can disrupt Company
operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility or a field-based
Teammate’s work territory. Management will determine if the office or territory will be closed.
When hazardous conditions or severe weather occurs during the day, the senior leader or management within
the location will decide whether to close early. In the event the Company closes early due to hazardous or severe
weather, non-exempt Teammates will be paid for hours worked only and will otherwise be paid in accordance
with applicable federal and state law.
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled work will be paid,
up to a maximum of three days in any calendar year, subject to executive leadership approval.
When the Company is open, but a Teammate is unable to report to work because of hazardous or severe weather,
the Teammate should report any delay or absence to their supervisor/manager at the earliest possible time.
Teammates will be required to use accrued vacation time on days when the Company is open, but the Teammate
does not report to work because of inclement weather. For Teammates that do not have vacation available, non-
exempt Teammates will be paid only for time worked and exempt Teammates will not be paid for full-day
absences due to inclement weather. If the office remains open, Teammates must make a reasonable effort to
report to work as scheduled. Teammates should not take unnecessary risks to report to work in unsafe conditions.
