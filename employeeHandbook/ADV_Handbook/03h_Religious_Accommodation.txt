Religious Accommodation
The Company will provide reasonable accommodation for Teammates’ religious beliefs, observances and practices
when a need for such accommodation is identified and reasonable accommodation is possible. A reasonable
accommodation is one that eliminates the conflict between a Teammate’s religious beliefs, observances, or
practices and the Teammate’s job requirements, without causing undue hardship to the Company.
The Company has developed an accommodation process to assist Teammates, management and Human
Resources. Through this process, the Company establishes a system of open communication between Teammates
and the Company to discuss conflicts between religion and work and to take action to provide reasonable
accommodation for Teammates’ needs. The intent of this process is to ensure a consistent approach when
addressing religious accommodation requests. Any Teammate who perceives a conflict between job requirements
and any religious belief, observance, or practice should present the conflict and their request for accommodation
to the attention of their manager or Human Resources or submit a request online on the Workplace
