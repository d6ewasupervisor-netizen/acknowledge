Payroll Deductions
The law requires that the Company make certain deductions from the compensation a Teammate receives.
Deductions include applicable federal, state, and local income taxes and Social Security taxes. Upon a Teammate’s
request and authorization, the Company will also deduct appropriate amounts from a Teammate’s pay, as
required for participation in the Company’s voluntary benefit plans or other programs which serve to benefit the
Teammate.
In the event of an overpayment to a Teammate, the Company reserves the right to make appropriate payroll
deductions or use other alternative methods to recoup the overpayment, consistent with applicable federal and
state law. Questions concerning payroll deductions should be directed to the HR Shared Services.
The Company takes precautions to ensure that Teammates are paid correctly; however, if an error does occur,
the Teammate should notify a supervisor/manager within two weeks. The Company will make every attempt to
adjust the error no later than the Teammate’s next regular pay period.
Additionally, the Company will comply with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and no improper
deductions from the salary of exempt Teammates will be permitted. An exempt Teammate's salary is not subject
to deductions for variations in the quantity and quality of the work performed, but would be subject to certain
deductions for:
• Full day absences related to disability;
• Full day disciplinary suspensions for infractions of written policies;
• Family and Medical Leave absences (full or partial day absences);
• Offsetting amounts received as payment for jury and witness fees or military pay;
• The first or last week of employment if you work less than a full week; and/or
• Deductions required by law or permitted by law and authorized by the Teammate.
In any work week in which you work, an exempt Teammate’s salary may not be reduced for the following reasons:
• Partial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability;
• An absence due to a day when the facility is closed on a scheduled workday;
• Absences for jury duty, witness duty, or military leave in any week you perform work; and/or
• Any other deduction prohibited by state or federal law.
If you have questions about deductions from your pay, please contact your supervisor/manager or Human
Resources immediately. Your concerns will be fully investigated and, where appropriate, corrective action will be
taken. The Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report violations of this policy.
