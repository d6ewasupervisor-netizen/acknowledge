Parental Leave for School Visits
The Company recognizes the value of parental involvement in children’s education. For this reason, Teammates
who are parents, guardians, or custodians of children in licensed day care facilities or kindergarten through grade
12, will be provided a reasonable amount of unpaid time off for school visits and activities sponsored, approved
or supervised by the school or day care. Teammates who choose to take unpaid Parental Leave must provide their
supervisors/managers with reasonable advance notice and upon return from the leave, must provide
documentation that verifies the date and time of the visit.
Nothing in this policy limits your rights under the applicable state or local laws in your primary work location
including eligibility for paid parental leave or school activities time off provisions when applicable. In all cases, the
Company will comply with the applicable Parental Leave statute to the extent it is required to do so.
