Flex Schedule/Telework
Regular full-time Teammates may request a flexible work arrangement (FWA), which is an intermediate or long-
term change in the Teammate's regular working arrangement. There are two types of FWAs which Teammates
may request:
• Flextime: Enables Teammates to vary their arrival and departure times from the standard hours, while
continuing to work during core hours and a standard-length day.
• Telework: Enables Teammates to perform work that is traditionally performed in an office, at their home
or other off-site location.
A Teammate may request a FWA by presenting their supervisor/manager with a proposal that details the reason(s)
for the request and describes the anticipated effect on the business, the workflow, fellow Teammates, etc. The
Company will consider all FWA requests. However, it cannot approve requests or sustain previously approved
arrangements that are inconsistent with the Company's business operations or legal or contractual obligations.
