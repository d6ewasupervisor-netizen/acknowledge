Outside Contacts
Any inquiries received in connection with a Company investigation must be handled in a consistent manner. All
contacts related to Company business from an outside attorney or investigator, a court or a government agency
seeking information from the Company must immediately be referred to the Company’s Legal Department at
generalcounsel@youradv.com, without any further discussions with the contact. If the contact involves a criminal
investigation, Company counsel will advise you of your options.
