Bereavement Leave
The Company will provide up to three days of paid bereavement leave to regular full-time Teammates who need
time off due to the death of an immediate family member, except where allowed additional paid or unpaid time
off under applicable state or local law. “Immediate family” is defined as the Teammate’s spouse, legally
recognized/registered domestic partner, ex-spouse, ex-domestic partner, children (including step or foster),
siblings, stepsiblings, parents, stepparents, grandparents, step-grandparents, grandchildren, step-grandchildren
and the same for that of the Teammate’s spouse or legally recognized/registered domestic partner. Teammates
who wish to take time off due to these circumstances should notify their supervisor/manager as soon as they are
made aware of their need for a bereavement leave. The Company understands the deep impact that death can
have on an individual or family. Therefore, a Teammate may make arrangements with their supervisor/manager
for additional unpaid time off if approved. The Company will comply with all applicable federal, state, and local
laws regarding bereavement leave. For specific bereavement entitlements by state and municipality, please see
the Teammate Resources, Required Postings section on the Company intranet.
