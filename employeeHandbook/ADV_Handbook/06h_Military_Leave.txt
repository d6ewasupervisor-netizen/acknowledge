Military Leave
A military leave of absence will be granted to Teammates who are absent from work because of service in the
United States uniformed services in accordance with the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and any similar state law. Teammates are required to give their
supervisor/manager advance notice of their need for a leave, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it
is otherwise impossible or unreasonable. The leave will be unpaid. However, Teammates may use any available
paid time off for the absence.
For additional details and to apply for a Military Leave, Teammates should review the Leave of Absence section
on Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net.
