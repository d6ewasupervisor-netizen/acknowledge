Company Holidays
Teammates are eligible to receive paid Company holidays immediately upon assignment to a regular, full-time
position. Teammates in part-time, temporary and seasonal positions are not eligible for paid Company holidays.
The Company will generally observe core holidays. However, Business Units may have their own holiday schedules
and the Company has the right to modify or change any holiday schedule at any time. Business Units may also
have early release days or allow for modifications to scheduled shifts. The holiday schedule will be posted on the
Company intranet before the end of the calendar year for the upcoming calendar year.
If a Company holiday falls during an eligible Teammate’s sick time, vacation time or floating holiday, Company
holiday pay will be provided instead of such time. Company holidays are not paid during any leave of absence.
Company holiday hours are not considered time worked and will not be counted for the purposes of calculating
overtime. Further, Company holidays do not carry over from one calendar year to the next and are not paid out
upon termination of employment.
On occasion, compelling business needs may result in a manager having to require a Teammate to work on a
Company holiday. If an eligible non-exempt Teammate works on a Company holiday, they will receive holiday pay
based on an eight-hour workday plus wages at the hourly rate applicable to the work performed, unless otherwise
subject to applicable state and local laws. Exempt Teammates paid a weekly salary will receive no more than their
normal weekly salary for any week in which a holiday falls irrespective of whether they perform work on the
holiday.
