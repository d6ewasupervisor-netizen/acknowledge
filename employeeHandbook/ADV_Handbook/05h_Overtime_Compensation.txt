Overtime Compensation
When business needs cannot be met during regular working hours, you may be scheduled to work overtime. Non-
exempt Teammates will be paid overtime compensation as required by applicable federal, state and local laws
based on their primary work location. Overtime pay is calculated based on actual hours worked. Vacation, sick
time, Company and floating holidays and any other paid time off and leaves of absence will not be considered
hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime. Exempt Teammates working on a salary basis are not eligible
to earn overtime pay.
All overtime work performed by non-exempt Teammates must be authorized in advance. The Teammate may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for failing to obtain advance approval. However, a
non-exempt Teammate who works overtime hours without authorization will still be compensated for the time
worked.
