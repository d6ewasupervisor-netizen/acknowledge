At-Will Employment
While it is our hope that your employment with the Company will be mutually rewarding, it is important for you
to know that your employment with the Company is at-will, unless state law provides otherwise. This means that
your employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause or notice, by you or by the Company.
Nothing contained in this Handbook, nor any oral statement or other document provided to the Teammate will
guarantee that employment will be continued for any length of time. This policy is the only agreement between
you and the Company as to the duration of employment and the circumstances under which employment may be
terminated. Only the CEO has the authority to enter into an agreement that alters the at-will relationship and then
only in writing.
