Performance Reviews
Performance reviews provide an opportunity for regular full-time Teammates and supervisors/managers to
discuss current job performance, identify problems in the Teammate’s performance, identify individual work
objectives and goals, as well as possible career opportunities within the Company. Performance reviews will
generally be conducted at regular intervals, depending on the nature of the position, but supervisors/managers
and Teammates are strongly encouraged to informally discuss job performance and goals on a more frequent
basis.
