Acknowledgement of Receipt
I have received a copy of the Company’s Handbook and the applicable Supplement(s) for the locations in which I
work. I agree to read it and to comply with the policies and procedures described in the Handbook and
Supplement(s). If I have any questions regarding any of the Handbook’s provisions, I will consult with my
supervisor, manager or Human Resources. I understand that if I do not follow the policies and procedures
contained herein that I may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
I also understand that this Handbook is the most up-to-date version of the Company’s policies and procedures
and replaces any prior written and oral communications about the subjects contained in it.
I acknowledge that my employment relationship with the Company is “at-will”, meaning that, regardless of
anything contained in this Handbook and regardless of any custom or practice, either I or the Company may
terminate my employment at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, and with or without
procedural requirements. I understand that no representatives of the Company, other than the CEO in a writing
signed by him/her/them, may enter into any agreements, or make any representations, written or oral, to alter
my at-will status or otherwise create any contractual obligation between me and the Company.
I further acknowledge that this handbook and the policies contained herein are not intended to create (and shall
not be construed as creating) a contract (express or implied) for employment between the Company and any
Teammate and that said policies can be modified by the Company at any time, with or without notice to me, in its
sole and absolute discretion.
By signing below, I acknowledge that I have received and will abide by the Company’s Handbook and all the
policies within it, including those on harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and bringing complaints regarding
the same..
