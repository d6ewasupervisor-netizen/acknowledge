Media Inquiries
From time to time a Teammate may receive inquiries from the media, i.e., newspapers, television stations, radio
stations, magazines, websites, digital marketers, industry/association publications or other periodicals. Only those
designated by the CEO may comment to the media on behalf of the Company on Company policy or events
relevant to the Company. If a Teammate were to receive any media inquiry, the Teammate should decline to make
any comment on behalf of the Company and refer the inquirer to the Chief Communications Officer (CCO) or Chief
Legal Officer (CLO). Their contact information is available on the Company intranet. This rule does not prevent you
from speaking with the media, but you may not attempt to speak on behalf of the Company unless you have
specifically been authorized to do so by the CEO, CCO, or CLO.
