Access to Personnel Records
The Company maintains a personnel record on each Teammate. The personnel record includes such information
as the Teammate’s job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance, salary increases
and other employment records.
Personnel records are the property of the Company and access to the information they contain is restricted.
Generally, only Human Resources and Company supervisors/managers with a legitimate reason to review
information may access the records. Disclosure of your personnel record to outside sources will be limited.
However, the Company will cooperate with official requests from authorized law enforcement or federal, state or
local agencies in the Teammate’s primary work location and as otherwise legally required.
Teammates who wish to review their own records should submit a request form, available on the Human
Resources page on the Company intranet. Personnel records will be made available to Teammates or their
authorized representative, for review or copy, subject to applicable law, within a reasonable time frame from the
date the Company receives the Teammate’s written request and any required authorization. Teammates are also
encouraged to use self-service resources available on MyOracle to retrieve basic personnel-related information,
such as pay records, dates of hire, assignment details, etc.
