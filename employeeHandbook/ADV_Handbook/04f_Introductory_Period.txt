Introductory Period
The first 90 days of continuous employment is considered an introductory period. While we are continuously
evaluating your performance and providing feedback regardless of your employment tenure, during this time your
supervisor/manager will monitor more closely your capabilities and work habits and evaluate if this new role is
the right role for you.
Teammates who are rehired, promoted or transferred within the Company must complete a 90-day introductory
period with each new assignment. Any absence will extend an introductory period by the length of the absence.
If the introductory period does not allow sufficient time to evaluate the Teammate’s performance, the
introductory period may be extended for a specified period.
Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment or change the at-will policy
that states the employment relationship may be terminated with or without cause and with or without advance
notice, at any time by you or the Company.
