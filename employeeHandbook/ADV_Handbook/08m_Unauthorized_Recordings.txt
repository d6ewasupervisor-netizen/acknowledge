Unauthorized Recordings
The Company recognizes the need to comply with state law and to protect its confidential, proprietary information
from unauthorized disclosure while also avoiding deceptive practices that do not promote honest, ethical
standards of business conduct. As such, the Company prohibits the unauthorized or secret recording in any
restrooms or changing areas and/or when confidential, proprietary, trade secrets or personal information
belonging to the Company or its Teammates, customers or clients is being discussed or revealed.
Teammates are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding recording, including
laws pertaining to two-party consent where applicable.
This policy is not intended and should not be construed to interfere, infringe, or restrain Teammate rights
