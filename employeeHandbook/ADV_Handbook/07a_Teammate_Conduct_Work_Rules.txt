Teammate Conduct and Work Rules Policy
The Company is committed to operating and maintaining a work environment built on professionalism, respect
and safety. Accordingly, Teammates are expected to act with integrity towards each other as well as clients,
customers and vendors (collectively “Business Partners”) and members of the public and to exercise sound
judgment and professionalism in carrying out their job responsibilities and otherwise representing the Company,
its clients and customers.
Work rules are generally intended to apply to Teammate conduct during working time, at business or work related
events, while representing the Company and when on Company or Business Partner property. However, there
may be occasions where conduct outside of the workplace is determined by the Company to be job-related and
to impact a Teammate’s ability to effectively perform their job duties or represent the Company, its clients and
customers. In those instances, the Company reserves the right to consider such conduct unacceptable under
company policy and take disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Unacceptable conduct. The following list provides examples of some, but not all, forms of unacceptable conduct
and behavior that is against work rules that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. It is
to serve as a guideline to help Teammates understand Company expectations as it relates to professional and
acceptable work-related conduct and is not intended to be an exhaustive list:
• Falsification of employment records (including time records), employment information or other records;
or providing misleading information in Company or Business Partner records.
• Theft or unauthorized removal, use, possession, or distribution of Company or Business Partner property
or the property of its or their Teammates or visitors.

• Violation of any law, rule regulation or Company policy.
The Company may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a Teammate for failing to
adhere to work rules and standards of acceptable conduct. Ignorance of work rules or what is considered
unacceptable conduct is not an acceptable excuse. It is each Teammate's responsibility to learn and abide by these
rules.
As explained above, Teammates are reminded that employment is at-will, unless applicable state law provides
otherwise. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right to take any type of disciplinary action it deems necessary,
including termination of employment.
