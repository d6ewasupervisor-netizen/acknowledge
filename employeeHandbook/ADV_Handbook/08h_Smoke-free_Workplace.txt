Smoke-free Workplace
In keeping with the Company's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment and in compliance with
applicable federal and state laws, smoking is prohibited throughout the workplace, within a reasonable distance
from outside entrances and in Company vehicles. The policy applies to all Teammates, clients, customers,
consultants and visitors.
Smoking includes any kind of tobacco use, vaping and/or e-cigarettes. There are no exceptions to this policy.
Smoking is only permitted during break times and only in designated areas outside Company buildings.
Teammates using these areas are expected to dispose of any smoking debris safely and properly.
Teammates found in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. Teammates who observe other
individuals smoking in the workplace have a right to object and should report the violation to their
supervisor/manager. No Teammate will be disciplined or retaliated against for reporting smoking that violates the
law or Company policy.
