Workplace Safety
The health and safety of Teammates and others on Company property are of critical concern to the Company. The
Company intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business as we strive to attain the
highest possible level of safety in all activities and operations.
The Company relies on our Teammates to help ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous
conditions. Teammates should carefully observe their work areas and immediately report any unsafe conditions
or potential hazards to their supervisor/manager. Additionally, any workplace injury, accident or illness must be
reported to a supervisor/manager immediately, regardless of the severity.
The Company has developed a written Injury and Illness Prevention Program in support of workplace health and
safety. This program can be found in the Safety and Workers’ Compensation section on the Company intranet.
Teammates must observe the Injury and Illness Prevention Program provisions, as well as all health and safety
guidelines related to their position, as strict compliance is required of all Teammates.
