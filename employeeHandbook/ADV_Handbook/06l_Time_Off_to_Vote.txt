Time Off to Vote
The Company encourages all Teammates to fulfill their civic responsibilities and to vote in official public elections.
Generally, working hours are such that a Teammate will have ample time to cast a vote before or after the work
shift. If Teammates do not have sufficient time to vote, that Teammate should discuss the matter with a
supervisor/manager. The Company will comply with all applicable state and municipal voting time laws which can
be found here.
