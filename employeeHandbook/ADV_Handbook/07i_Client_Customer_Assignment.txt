Client / Customer Assignment Policy
The Company represents many clients and customers that are considered “Third Parties.” The Company asks
Teammates to keep in mind the following when working with Third Parties:
• Our Teammates are Teammates of the Company, not the Third Party.
• Our Teammates are expected to abide by our Company’s policies and procedures
• Our Teammates are expected to adhere to Third Party policies and procedures, when applicable
• Our Teammates may be required to undergo a Complete Blood Count screening or other screening to be
on a Third Party’s property
• Questions regarding Company policies, one’s job expectations, or other workplace matters should be
directed to a Company supervisor/manager or Human Resources.
• Teammates are expected to receive and take direction regarding job expectations and performance from
their Company supervisor/manager, although Third Parties may communicate task-execution
information.
• Third Party communications which appear to be against Company policy or legal or ethical obligations and
any other concerns pertaining to Third Parties, must be promptly escalated to your immediate
supervisor/manager or using another reporting channel pursuant to the Company’s Open Door Policy.
