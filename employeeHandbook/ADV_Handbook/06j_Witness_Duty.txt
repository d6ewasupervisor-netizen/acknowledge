Witness Duty
The Company encourages Teammates to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If
Teammates have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested by the Company to testify as witnesses, they will
receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. Teammates will be granted unpaid time off to appear
as a witness when requested to appear by a party other than the Company. Teammates may use available vacation
or floating holiday hours as compensation for this absence. Exempt Teammates will not incur any reduction in pay
for a partial week of absence due to witness duty.
Teammates are required to show their supervisor/manager the subpoena immediately after it is received and
provide reasonable advance notice so that operating requirements can be adjusted to accommodate the
Teammate’s absence.
