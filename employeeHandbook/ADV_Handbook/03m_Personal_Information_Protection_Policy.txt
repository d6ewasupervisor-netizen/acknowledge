Personal Information Protection Policy
The Company is committed to safeguarding the privacy of its candidates and current and former Teammates.
Accordingly, the Company will take appropriate steps to ensure those interests are protected with respect to the
receipt, use, disclosure, transmission, storage and destruction of Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”) and
Confidential Teammate (or Applicant) Information (“CAI”). All Teammates are responsible for complying with the
following Company policy on PII and CAI.
Personal Identifiable Information is information that can be used to identify an individual. Any of the following,
in combination with an individual’s first name (or initial) and last name, is considered PII:
• Social Security or tax identification number
• Alien registration number
• Driver’s license number
• Passport number
• Federal or state-issued identification number
• Financial account number
• Credit or debit card number
• Health insurance policy or subscriber identification number
• Date of birth
• Other combination of the above data elements sufficient to identify an individual
Confidential Teammate (or Applicant) Information is any of the following, in combination with an individual’s
first name (or initial) and last name, or any of the above data elements, sufficient to identify an individual:
• Personal mailing/home address
• Personal home/residence phone number
• Personal mobile phone number
• Personal email address
• Precise geolocation of home and/or personal travel and destinations
• Company-issued Teammate identification numbers
• Medical records or information, including mental or physical health diagnosis
• Employment screening information (e.g., background check and drug test results)
• Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or
citizenship/immigration status
• Genetic or biometric data
PII and CAI should only be collected, used, stored and transmitted for legitimate business purposes. Teammates
in possession of PII or CAI should not disclose such information except: (1) as required to perform their job; (2) as
otherwise permitted or required by this policy or applicable law; or (3) as otherwise authorized or requested in
writing by the individual to whom the information relates.
Teammates who inadvertently receive or are provided access to PII or CAI for which there is no legitimate business
reason, are expected to: (1) promptly attempt to notify the sender of the inadvertent delivery, and if the sender
cannot be reached, notify Human Resources; (2) not disclose the information, except for the limited purpose of
complying with this policy; and (3) effectively destroy the information received.
Any Teammate who fails to comply with their responsibilities as they relate to PII or CAI as set forth in this policy
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
As a Company Teammate, you may have access to other information that people outside the Company never see
and to confidential information of third parties. “Confidential information” includes, but is not limited to: (a) the
identities, contact information, financial information, or other personal information of any of the Company’s
clients; (b) the Company’s advertising and marketing strategies, methods, research and related data; (c) the names
of any of the Company’s vendors or suppliers; (d) the cost, type and quantity of materials and/or supplies ordered
by the Company; (e) the prices at which the Company obtains or has obtained or sells or has sold its services; (f)
the Company’s costs, methods and objectives (including those methods licensed from other entities); (g) any
technical information owned or created by the Company or licensed from another entity; (h) any inventions,
techniques or proprietary methods; (i) any pending or issued patents; (j) financial or tax records; (k) any “trade
secrets” as such term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and applicable common law or any other
confidential information of, about, or concerning the business of the Company; and/or (l) such other confidential
information or data of any kind, nature, or description as may be designated as “Confidential” from time to time
by the Company.
All Confidential Information, no matter where or when obtained, must be kept confidential at all times and may
only be disclosed to those Teammates of the Company who are authorized to receive such information and who
also have a demonstrated need for such information. In addition to non-disclosure, you may not use confidential
information for personal profit or gain, or for any purpose outside your employment by the Company. The
Company, in turn, respects other companies’ proprietary and confidential information and requires Teammates
to treat such information with the same level of care and degree of privacy as they would the Company’s own
confidential and proprietary information.
This policy does not restrict or interfere with a Teammate’s rights under federal, state or local labor law. The
definition of “Confidential Information” does not include wages or a statutory Teammate’s terms and conditions
of employment. This policy is not intended to prohibit Teammates from discussing, disclosing and comparing
information regarding Teammate terms and conditions of employment, which include wages and working
conditions. To the extent any federal, state, or local laws for a Teammate’s primary work location impose
additional or more specific requirements with respect to protection of personal or confidential information, the
Company is committed to complying with such requirements. The Company will not terminate or otherwise
discriminate against Teammates because they make such inquiries, disclosures, comparisons or discussions about
their wages or the wages of another Teammate.
Moreover, this policy is not intended to restrict any rights that statutorily defined Teammates may have under
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or other similar laws to discuss their wages and/or terms and conditions
of employment.
