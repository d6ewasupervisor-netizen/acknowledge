Job Posting
Job postings may be placed on the Company intranet to inform Teammates of current openings that may provide
an opportunity for potential advancement within the organization. Teammates are encouraged to talk with their
supervisors/managers about their career plans and apply for any open position, according to their skills and
experience. Teammates must be in good standing to apply for any open position within the Company. To indicate
their interest in an opening for which they are qualified, Teammates should follow the guidelines found in this
handbook or on the Company intranet.
While the Company will attempt to fill open positions with qualified internal candidates, the Company reserves
the right, where permitted by law, to fill a position without posting the opening and/or by using any recruiting
source that is in the best interest of the Company.
