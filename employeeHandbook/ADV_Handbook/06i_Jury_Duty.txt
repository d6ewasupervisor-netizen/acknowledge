Jury Duty
The Company encourages Teammates to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving on jury duty when required.
The Company will grant full-time regular Teammates up to five consecutive working days of paid time off per
calendar year for jury duty, unless applicable state or local laws require additional time. Teammates may use
accrued but unused vacation or floating holiday hours as compensation for any hours that are unpaid. Temporary,
seasonal and part-time Teammates are not eligible to receive paid time off for jury duty service, unless otherwise
provided for by law. Exempt Teammates will not incur any reduction in pay for a partial week of absence due to
jury duty.
Teammates must give the Company advance notice of their need to serve. Furthermore, the Teammate must
submit written documentation that confirms their jury duty attendance to their supervisor/manager after
completion of each jury duty service date.
