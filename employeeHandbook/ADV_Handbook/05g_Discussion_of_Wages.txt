Discussion of Wages
No Teammate is prohibited from inquiring about, discussing or disclosing their own wages or those of another
Teammate. The Company will not terminate, demote, suspend, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against any
Teammate on the basis of such a disclosure or because they file a complaint or charge or otherwise institute an
investigation, proceeding or hearing based on the disclosure of wage information.
This does not apply to the unauthorized disclosure of other Teammates' wage information by those acting on
behalf of the Company with access to such information as part of their job duties. Company representatives may
disclose Teammates' wages in response to a complaint or charge, or an investigation, proceeding, hearing or other
legal action as appropriate or required by law.
