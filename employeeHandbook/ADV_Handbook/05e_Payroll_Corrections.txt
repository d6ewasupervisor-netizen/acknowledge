Payroll Corrections
The Company is committed to paying its Teammates correctly, but mistakes can happen. Teammates should
review each paycheck and pay stub as soon as it is received and make sure your pay is correct. If you believe an
error has occurred or if you have any questions about your pay, please promptly report the matter to your
supervisor or manager or promptly notify Human Resources by calling (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket via
ServiceNow. When mistakes do occur and are brought to the Company’s attention, the required corrections will
promptly be made.
