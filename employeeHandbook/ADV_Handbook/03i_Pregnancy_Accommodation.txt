Pregnancy Accommodation
The Company will not discriminate against a Teammate because they are pregnant or treat a Teammate that it
knows is pregnant differently from a non-pregnant person whose ability or inability to work is similar to that of
the pregnant Teammate. “Pregnancy” means “pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy
or childbirth, including recovery from childbirth.” Under the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (“PWFA”), the
Company will make reasonable accommodations, including providing time off, for known physical or mental
limitations of Teammates related to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, unless the
accommodation would impose an undue hardship. “Known physical or mental limitations” are those that the
Teammate has communicated to the Company.
Teammates who wish to inform the Company of such a limitation and/or request a reasonable accommodation
should contact Human Resources in writing and specify what barriers or limitations prompted the request.
Teammates may also request a workplace accommodation through the Workplace Accommodations section on
Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net or by reaching out to Human Resources at (888)-900-4276 or via
ServiceNow. Human Resources will engage in an interactive process with the Teammate to determine the nature
of the limitation and what, if any, reasonable accommodation(s) may be appropriate. Documentation from a
health care provider supporting your need, duration, frequency and the nature of your work restrictions in
connection with your requested accommodation may be required as part of this process. Teammates are required
to cooperate with the Company in the interactive process.
Teammates who wish to request unpaid time away from work due to pregnancy should speak to Human Resources
regarding a proposed reasonable accommodation.
