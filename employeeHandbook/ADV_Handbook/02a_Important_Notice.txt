Important Notice About the ADV Teammate Handbook
The ADV Teammate Handbook (“Handbook”) contains information about employment policies and practices for
all Teammates of Advantage Solutions Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Advantage Solutions” or “the Company”) who
work in the United States. This Handbook is designed to acquaint you with Advantage Solutions and provide you
with information about working conditions, Teammate benefits and some of the policies affecting your
employment. You should read and understand the contents of this Handbook as you are required to remain in
compliance with all provisions. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Handbook may result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
Advantage Solutions operates in many locations and its Company policies may apply to Teammates working in a
state with greater or different rights. The Company complies not only with federal, but also with applicable state
and local laws. Please consult with Human Resources or review the State Supplements to this Handbook if you
have any questions concerning this Handbook, or how the state and local law requirements may differ from the
information presented here.
Except for the policy of at-will employment, the Company reserves the right to revise, modify, delete or add to
any policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this Handbook at any time. However, any such changes
must be in writing and signed by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. Any changes to this
Handbook will be communicated to all Teammates in writing. No oral statements or representations can in any
way alter the provisions of this Handbook.
Nothing in this Handbook or in any other Company document or policy constitutes, or is intended to constitute,
an express or implied contract guaranteeing continued employment for any Teammate. No manager or supervisor
has any authority to enter into a contract of employment that changes the at-will employment relationship or
changes any of the provisions of this Handbook. Only the CEO of the Company has the authority to enter into an
employment agreement that alters the at-will employment relationship and any such agreement must be in
writing and must be signed by the CEO. Similarly, changes to this Handbook must be made by an official writing,
signed by the CEO.
Nothing in this Handbook or in any other document or policy is intended to violate any federal, state or local law.
Additionally, nothing in this Handbook is intended to limit any concerted activities by Teammates protected by
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act relating to their wages, hours or working conditions or any other
protected conduct. Furthermore, nothing in this Handbook prohibits a Teammate from reporting concerns, filing
a charge or complaint with, making lawful disclosures to, providing documents or other information to or
participating in an investigation or hearing conducted by any federal, state or local agency charged with
enforcement of any laws, or communicating with any governmental authority about conduct the Teammate
believes violates any laws or regulations.
This Handbook supersedes all previous versions of the Handbook issued by the Company and any inconsistent
verbal or written policy statements made or issued before this Handbook. Many matters covered by this
Handbook are also described in separate official documents. While they should be consistent, if there is any
difference, the official policies will prevail. Official policies and this Handbook will also prevail over any conflicting
representations and/or statements made by supervisors or managers. Please direct questions on any Handbook
or State Supplement policies to Human Resources.
