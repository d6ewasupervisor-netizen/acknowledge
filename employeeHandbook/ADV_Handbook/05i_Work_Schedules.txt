Work Schedules
Work schedules for Teammates vary throughout our organization. Supervisors/managers will advise Teammates
of their individual work schedules. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting
and ending times, as well as variations in the locations and the total hours that may be scheduled each day and
week for each Teammate. The Company will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding
scheduling Teammates.
