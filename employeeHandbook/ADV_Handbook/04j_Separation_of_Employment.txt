Separation of Employment
The Company strives to ensure that Teammate terminations are handled fairly, efficiently and in compliance with
applicable laws. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Voluntary Termination. A voluntary termination occurs when a Teammate makes the decision to end the
working relationship with the Company. Although not required based on the at-will nature of your
employment, Teammates who voluntarily terminate their employment are asked to provide their
supervisor/manager with at least two weeks' written notice.
• Involuntary Termination. An involuntary termination occurs when the Company decides to end the working
relationship with a Teammate.
• Reduction in Force. Reductions in force generally occur if changes in business conditions create a need to
reduce the number of people employed.
Final wages will be paid in accordance with applicable law. Vacation, sick leave and floating holidays will not be
paid upon termination, unless otherwise required by the applicable state or local laws in a Teammate’s work
location. Some benefits may be continued at the Teammate’s expense if the Teammate so chooses. The
Teammate will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions and
limitations of any such benefits.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit or alter the at-will nature of your employment. Employment may be
terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject to applicable
law.
