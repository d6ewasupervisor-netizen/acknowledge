Transfer Policy
The Company provides Teammates with a variety of ways to grow in their career and contribute to the growth
and value of the Company. Teammates are encouraged to explore transfer opportunities by viewing the
Company’s open positions on the Company intranet and by discussing career growth and development
opportunities with their supervisor/manager.
To help Teammates achieve their career goals, reasonable efforts will be made to post vacant positions and fill
them from within the organization. At the same time, in order to hire the most qualified candidate for the position,
the Company reserves the right to fill a position with someone outside the Company and without any job posting.
Unless transfer is part of a reasonable accommodation under applicable law, to be considered for a transfer, a
Teammate must have held their current position for at least six months, notify their current supervisor/manager
of intent to apply and be in good standing (i.e., meeting or exceeding performance expectations, following
Company policies, maintaining a positive attitude, no active disciplinary actions). If the Teammate is offered and
accepts the transfer, (1) the Teammate will promptly inform their current supervisor/manager; (2) the current
and new supervisor/manager will agree on a mutually convenient transfer date (generally in approximately two
weeks if possible); (3) the new supervisor/manager will inform the Teammate of the transfer date; and (4) the
current and new supervisor/manager will be responsible for processing the transfer.
Transfer to another position within the Company does not change the at-will employment relationship or create
a guarantee or contract of employment for any specific period of time, unless state law provides otherwise. If you
require transfer as a reasonable accommodation for a disability, pregnancy or as part of a religious observance,
please contact Human Resources.
