Bonuses and Awards
A Teammate may receive additional income in the form of bonus, commission, incentive, gift card or other awards
(collectively, “Rewards”) resulting from participation in one or more of the Company’s Rewards and Recognition
programs. Company management will partner with the Total Rewards Department to administer the Company’s
Rewards and Recognition programs according to program guidelines and in compliance with all applicable tax
requirements.
Teammates are not eligible for programs developed directly by a customer or client of the Company without the
express written knowledge and consent of management. Management reserves the right to approve or disallow
any such third-party sponsored program.
All monies distributed through such programs will be issued through the standard payroll processes. Cash or
noncash payments from Clients or Customers directly to a Company Teammate violate the Company’s policy
under all circumstances.
Teammates are encouraged to review the Company’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics for information regarding
Accounting and Financial Practices. In addition, please see Section on Gifts, Meals and Entertainment for
additional information.
