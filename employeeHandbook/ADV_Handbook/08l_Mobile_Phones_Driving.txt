Use of Mobile Phones and Devices While Driving
Teammates who drive for business reasons and use a Company or personal mobile telephone or device, are
expected to put safety first. Therefore, for your safety, the safety of others and for the safeguarding of Company
property, Teammates are not to use Company or personal mobile telephones or devices while driving for Company
business. This includes all mobile telephone and device functionalities including talking, texting, retrieving or
viewing messages, emails or data. If you need to use a mobile telephone or device at a time when you are driving,
you must do so when you reach your destination, or pull over and safely and legally park before using the mobile
telephone or device. Teammates may use a hands-free mobile device while driving where applicable state or local
law has a hands-free driving law in place. In such situations, Teammates must adhere to the requirements of such
laws.
Teammates who are charged with traffic violations, or cause accidents or injuries, resulting from their use of
personal or Company mobile telephones or personal devices while driving for business will be solely responsible
for all liabilities and fines that result from such actions to the extent permissible under applicable law and may be
subject to discipline, up to and including termination from employment.
Teammates whose job responsibilities do not specifically include driving as an essential function, but who are
issued a Company-provided mobile telephone for business use or who use their personal mobile telephone for
business use, are also expected to abide by the provisions of this policy.
