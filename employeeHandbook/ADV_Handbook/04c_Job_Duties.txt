Job Duties
When you begin your employment with the Company, your manager will explain your job responsibilities and the
performance standards expected of you. The expectations of one’s job depends on one’s position and job duties
according to their job description or as otherwise communicated by management. Be aware that some or all of
your job responsibilities may be subject to change at any time during your employment. From time to time, you
may be asked to work on special projects, or to assist with other work necessary or important to the operation of
your department or the Company. Your cooperation and assistance in performing such additional work is
expected.
The Company reserves the right, at any time, with or without notice, to alter or change job responsibilities,
reassign or transfer job positions, or assign additional job responsibilities.
