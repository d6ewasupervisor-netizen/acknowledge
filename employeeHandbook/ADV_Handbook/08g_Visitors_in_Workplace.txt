Visitors in The Workplace
To provide for the safety and security of Teammates and the facilities of the Company, only authorized visitors
are allowed in the workplace. All visitors must enter Company facilities at the reception area and sign-in as
directed. Authorized visitors will receive directions or be escorted to their destination. Teammates are responsible
for the conduct and safety of their visitors.
If an unauthorized individual is observed on the Company’s premises, Teammates should immediately notify their
direct supervisor/manager or, if necessary, guide the individual to the reception area.
