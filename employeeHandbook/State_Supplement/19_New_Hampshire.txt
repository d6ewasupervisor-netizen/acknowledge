NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPPLEMENT
Whistleblower Protections
As is set forth more fully in the Reporting and Anti-Retaliation Policy in the Handbook, the
Company is committed to promoting compliance with the laws, rules and regulations that govern
its business operations. The Company will not retaliate against, or tolerate retaliation against, any
Teammate who in good faith:
• Reports or causes to be reported an alleged violation of law;
• Objects to or refuses to participate in any activity that the Teammate, in good faith,
believes is a violation of the law;
• Participates in an investigation, hearing or inquiry conducted by any governmental entity
or any court concerning allegations that the Company violated the law; or
• Refuses to execute a directive that violates any law or rule adopted by the state or political
subdivision of the United States.
Teammates who wish to report a concern regarding a possible violation of law or who feel they
have been retaliated against for making such a report should immediately contact their supervisor,
a Human Resources representative or contact the Company’s ethics hotline.
Teammates should also consult the Anti-Harassment Policy set forth in the Handbook for further
information about reporting potential misconduct and protections from retaliation.
Meal Breaks
Teammates who work five hours or more in a shift will be entitled to one 30-minute meal break.
Teammates will be relieved of all duties during the meal break.
An uninterrupted 30-minute meal break will be unpaid for nonexempt Teammates.
Any Teammate who is unable to take all of the meal breaks to which they are entitled in
accordance with this policy, or who has been prevented or discouraged from taking a break to
which they are entitled under this policy, should immediately notify a Human Resources
representative. All nonexempt Teammates must record their meal breaks.
