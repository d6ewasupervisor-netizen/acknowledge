KENTUCKY SUPPLEMENT
Overtime
Teammates who are not exempt from overtime requirements will be paid overtime in compliance
with federal and state law. In addition to the overtime pay provisions set forth in the Handbook,
Kentucky Teammates who are nonexempt, work more than 40 hours in a week and work every
day during a seven-day workweek will be paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for
all time worked on the seventh day.
This policy does not apply to any officer, foreman or supervisor whose duties are principally limited
to directing or supervising other Teammates.
Meal and Rest Breaks
Teammates are entitled to a reasonable meal break, scheduled as close as possible to the middle
of their scheduled shift. Teammates will not be required to take their meal break sooner than three
hours or later than five hours after the start of their shift.
During the meal break, Teammates will be relieved of all duties. An uninterrupted 30-minute meal
break will be unpaid for nonexempt Teammates.
Teammates are also entitled to a 10-minute paid rest break for every four hours of work.
Any Teammate who is unable to take all of the meal or rest breaks to which they are entitled in
accordance with this policy, or who has been prevented or discouraged from taking a break to
which they are entitled under this policy, should immediately notify Human Resources.
All nonexempt Teammates must record their meal and rest breaks.
