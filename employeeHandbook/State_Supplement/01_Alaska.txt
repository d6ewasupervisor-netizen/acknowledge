Overtime
When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours,
Teammates may be scheduled to work overtime. All overtime must be approved in advance by
the Teammate’s supervisor. Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary
action up to and including termination of employment.
Nonexempt Teammates will be paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours
worked beyond eight hours in any given day and beyond 40 hours in any given work week.
