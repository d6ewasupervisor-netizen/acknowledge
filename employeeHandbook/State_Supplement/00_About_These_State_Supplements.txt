ABOUT THESE STATE SUPPLEMENTS
Advantage Solutions Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Advantage Solutions” or “the Company”) is
committed to workplace policies and practices that comply with federal, state, and local laws. For
this reason, U.S.-based Teammates receive the Company’s ‘ADV Teammate Handbook’ (the
“Handbook”) and these state supplements to the Handbook (“State Supplements”). The State
Supplements should be read together with the Handbook and, to the extent that the policies in
the State Supplement applicable to a Teammate are distinct from or are more generous than
those in the Handbook, the State Supplement applicable to the Teammate will control.
These State Supplements are not intended to create a contract of continued employment or alter
the at-will employment relationship between the Company and any Teammate. Only the CEO of
the Company has the authority to enter into an employment agreement that alters the at-
will employment relationship, and any such agreement must be in writing signed by the
CEO of the Company.
If a Teammate has any questions about these policies, they should contact Human Resources.
