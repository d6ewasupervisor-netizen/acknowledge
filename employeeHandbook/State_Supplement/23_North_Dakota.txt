NORTH DAKOTA SUPPLEMENT
Meal Breaks
Teammates who work five hours or more in a shift will be entitled to a 30-minute meal break, as
long as there are two or more Teammates on duty. During the meal break, Teammates will be
relieved of all duties. An uninterrupted 30-minute meal break will be unpaid for nonexempt
Teammate.
Teammates may voluntarily waive the meal break. Any such agreement must be in writing.
Any Teammate who is unable to take all of the meal breaks to which they are entitled in
accordance with this policy, or who has been prevented or discouraged from taking a break to
which they are entitled under this policy, should immediately notify a Human Resources
representative. All nonexempt Teammates must record their meal breaks.
Vacation
A non-exempt Teammate will accrue available time for vacation at a rate set forth in the
Handbook. This time is available to the Teammate to use for vacation but will not be deemed to
have been earned until the Teammate requests and is approved for vacation time by the
Teammate’s supervisor or the Human Resources department. Teammates will forfeit all available
but unearned vacation time when separating from the Company. Stated another way, payment
will not be made to Teammates for any available but unearned vacation at the time of separation.
For Teammates who have worked for the Company for less than one year and voluntarily leave
their employment, payment will not be made for earned but unused vacation, unless they give the
Company written or verbal notice of their separation at least five days in advance.
Teammates will be provided with reasonable opportunity to make use of accrued vacation.
