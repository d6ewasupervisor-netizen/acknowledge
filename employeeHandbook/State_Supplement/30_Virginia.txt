VIRGINIA SUPPLEMENT
Reasonable Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities
Teammates and job applicants have the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of
disability and the right to request reasonable accommodations for disabilities. It is unlawful for an
employer in Virginia with five or more Teammates to take certain actions against a job applicant
or Teammate because of disability. Accordingly, the Company will not:
• Fail or refuse to hire, discharge or otherwise discriminate against any individual on the
basis of disability;
• Refuse to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental
impairments of an otherwise qualified person with a disability, if necessary to assist that
person in performing a particular job, unless the accommodation would impose an undue
hardship on the Company’s business, consistent with Virginia law;
• Take adverse action against a Teammate because they request or use a reasonable
accommodation in accordance with this policy;
• Deny employment or promotion opportunities to an otherwise qualified applicant or
Teammate because the Company will be required to make reasonable accommodation(s)
consistent with this policy; or
• Require a Teammate to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided
to the known limitations related to the disability.
The Company will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental
impairments of an otherwise qualified Teammate or applicant with a disability, unless undue
hardship would result. Teammates with questions or concerns regarding this policy or who would
like to request an accommodation should contact Human Resources. Teammates should also
consult the Disability and Accommodation policy provided the Company’s Handbook. The
Company will engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with a Teammate who requests
an accommodation. The Company has the right to choose among equally effective
accommodations.
